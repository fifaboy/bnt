# Basic Number Theory
This is the note I wrote on elementary number theory in 2010-11 (most probably, don't remember for sure). If you have any contributions to make, feel free to make a pull request or email me: billalmasum93@gmail.com
Note: Please do not use this for any financial gain. Other than that, you can share or distribute this any way you want. You can also create issues for typos or errors if you want.

## If You Want To Contribute
Please do not use any custom style files with it. Just write everything in the source files itself. And if you use new environments, keep comments explaining what it does for debugging purpose. And in the git commit, write why you think this change should be made.

Moreover, do not edit or remove existing environments or commands. I will accept contributions only via git pull requests, so no changes can be made directly to the source file and added them to the original. Append any new command below the existing commands only. Same for new environments or theorems etc.

Another important thing to mention here would be the indentation. Indentation means proper spacing while writing the codes for readability. No matter how good your contribution is, if you do not follow proper indentation, I will not accept any contribution. You should be able to understand the indentation convention, but just in case, I will mention this once again. Indent whenever you are about to enter an environment such as theorem or definition or equation. And unindent when you are done. Indent for new sections or similar headings as well. Also, use references the proper way with bibliography.
