# Basic Number Theory
This is the note I wrote on elementary number theory in 2010-11 (most probably, don't remember for sure). If you have any contributions to make, feel free to email me: billalmasum93@gmail.com
And please do not use this for any financial gain. Other than, you can share or distribute this any way you want. You can also create issues if you want.

## If You Want To Edit
Please do not use any custom style files with it. Just write everything in the source files itself. And if you use new environments, keep comments explaining what it does for debugging purpose. And in the git commit, write why you think this change should be made.
